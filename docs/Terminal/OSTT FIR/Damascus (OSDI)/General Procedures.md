# 2. General Procedures

## General Provisions

Approach is responsible for providing surveillance-based separation service to departing and arriving traffic operating within the Damascus TMA for Damascus (OSDI)

Radar services are limited due to the low range radar, so controllers are expected to follow procedural airspace policies further than **20NM** from the airfield.

## Separation Expectations

Aircraft operating within the Damascus TMA shall be separated horizonally by at least **5NM** in radar airspace, and **15NM** in procedural airspace. If this is unable to be achieved, minimum vertical separation of **1000ft** shall be applied.

Controllers are encouraged to use their brain and issue appropriate speed and altitude instructions, ensuring that the lateral path of two aircraft are to never cross and minimum separation minima is met.

## Wake Turbulence Separation

Wake Turbulence Separation shall always be applied below **7000ft** under the following circumstances:

- An aircraft is operating directly behind another at the same altitude or less than **1000ft** below
- Both aircraft are using the same runway, or a parallel runway separated by less than **760 meters**.
- An aircraft is crossing behind another aircraft at the same altitude or less than **1000ft** below

## Damascus Runway Configurations

In Damascus, runway **D23L A23R** is the preferred runway configuration as the SIDs and STARs are best designed for those runways. However, in special circumstances, such as tailwind exceeding **8KTS** in the RWY23 config, runway **D05R A05L** may be used.

## Sectorization

Damascus TMA is controlled by a single position, OSDI_APP, who is responsible for all departing and arriving traffic within Damascus TMA.

## Radiotelephony

Standard phraseology must be followed at all times, see the procedural tab on the left for procedural phraseology.

## Maximum aircraft permitted per sector

| Online sector | Max number of aircraft |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| OSDI_APP | up to 6 |
