# 4. Transfer Procedures

## General

The transfer prcoedures must be adhered to at all times. Due to the unreliable radar, the tag must first be sent over to the next controller, accepted by them, then an instruction may be given to contact the next controller. 

Any deviation from these procedures shall require strategic coordination between all concerned controllers. 

!!! warning
    Any deviation from these procedures **without** coordination is very haram. If you do it consistently then be assured that Sebastian will hunt you down.

## Transfers from Center (CTR) to Radar (APP)

Traffic coming from CTR to arrive at OSDI will be given a descent to **FL150** unless otherwise coordinated and if conditions allow. Speed restrictions may be given if circumstances allow, however, a strict adherance to **250 or less below 10000ft** must be followed due to the size of Damascus TMA.

Traffic departing OSDI will be given a climb to **FL150** unless otherwise coordinated and if conditions allow. Speed restrictions may be given if circumstances allow, however, a strict adherance to **250 or less below 10000ft** must be followed due to the size of the Damascus TMA.
