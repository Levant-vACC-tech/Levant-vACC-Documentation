# 5. Arrival Procedures

## Approach and runway assignment

On initial contact with aircraft, APP shall assign the concerned aircraft with the assigned arrival runway and approach type for the relevant runway.

Aircraft shall always be given a QNH if they are descending below the transition level.

!!! phraseology
    "UAE913, Damascus Radar, expect RNAV approach runway 23R"<br>"UAE913 descend and maintain 9000ft QNH 1002."

## RNAV Approach

When using the 23s configuration, the RNAV approach is the preferred approach type as it offers the lowest minima and greatest ease for the controller and the pilot. Aircraft may be given a visual approach only if they request it or other factors do not allow an RNAV. A VOR or ILS approach is unavailable as they are all out of service.

## Visual Approach

When using the 05s configuration, a visual approach is the only option available as there is no ILS, no RNAV and VOR is out of service, therefore, it is not recommended to use the 05s configuration due to these reasons. Before clearing an aircraft for a visual, APP must:

- Give traffic information for any relevant traffic on the approach path, with the aircraft reporting them in sight and agreeing to accept responsibility to maintain own separation.
- Give a warning on any wake turbulence threats if applicable
- Ensure the aircraft has the runway in sight before commencing the approach.

!!! note
    Aircraft must be within **40Â°** of the extended centerline before being given an approach clearance.
