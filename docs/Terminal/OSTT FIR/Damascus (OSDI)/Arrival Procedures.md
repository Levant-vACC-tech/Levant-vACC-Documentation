# 5. Arrival Procedures

## Approach and runway assignment

On initial contact with aircraft, APP shall assign the concerned aircraft with the assigned arrival runway and approach type for the relevant runway.

Aircraft shall always be given a QNH if they are descending below the transition level.

!!! phraseology
    "UAE913, Damascus Radar, expect RNAV approach runway 23R"<br>"UAE913 descend and maintain 9000ft QNH 1002."

### RNAV Approach

When using the 23s configuration, the RNAV approach is the preferred approach type as it offers the lowest minima and greatest ease for the controller and the pilot. Aircraft may be given a visual approach only if they request it or other factors do not allow an RNAV. A VOR or ILS approach is unavailable as they are all out of service.

### Visual Approach

When using the 05s configuration, a visual approach is the only option available as there is no ILS, no RNAV and VOR is out of service, therefore, it is not recommended to use the 05s configuration due to these reasons. Before clearing an aircraft for a visual, APP must:

- Give traffic information for any relevant traffic on the approach path, with the aircraft reporting them in sight and agreeing to accept responsibility to maintain own separation.
- Give a warning on any wake turbulence threats if applicable
- Ensure the aircraft has the runway in sight before commencing the approach.

!!! note
    Aircraft must be within **40Â°** of the extended centerline before being given an approach clearance.

### Change of runway or approach type

A change of approach type or runway shall not be initiated by the controller within 30 NM of touchdown. Pilot initiated change of approach type/runway is permitted at any time.

## Speed control

Aircraft shall be given appropriate speeds to maintain separation.

The recommended speeds to be given are listed in the table below.

!!! note
    STARs in Damascus do not have any published STAR speeds.

| Speeds | Arrival Segment |
| ------ | --------------- |
| 220 knots | TMA entry |
| 200 knots | Approaching base turn |
| 180 knots | Base turn |
| 160 knots | Until 4NM |

!!! phraseology
    "UAE913, speed 210 knots."<br>**OR**<br>"UAE913, maintain speed 160 knots until 4 mile final"

### Deviation from recommended speeds

Deviation from the speeds listed on the table is highly advised against as the turn radius becomes larger, and may lead to overshoots on waypoints. In addition, it takes more distance for the aircraft to slow down, leading them to be too high on lateral profiles.

## Descent profile

Descent clearances shall be issued accordingly given traffic circumstances. Controllers are required to be aware of the MSAs within the Damascus TMA to ensure obstacle and terrain clearance. "Descend via STAR" clearances shall not be given.

!!! phraseology
    "UAE913, descend and maintain 6000 feet"

## Final Approach Sequencing

Descent for final approach shall be to the appropriate altitude, in this case, **3600ft** for all runways in OSDI.

Clearances to descend below the platform altitude is not permitted, as the platform altitude is equal to the minimum radar maneuvering altitude.

## Separation requirements on final

The minimum longitudinal separation of **5NM** shall be applied between arriving aircraft, however, this may be reduced to **3NM** in high volume environments.

### Low visibility operations (LVO)

When operating under LVO conditions, minimum longitudinal separation of **7NM** shall always be applied between arriving aircraft.

## Direct Routings

Unless coordinated, direct routings within Damascus TMA is only permitted within their designated AOR. If a direct routing is given, special care shall be given to ensure that no potential conflicts shall arise.

| KILO1C | SOFIA |
| LIMA1C | N/A |
