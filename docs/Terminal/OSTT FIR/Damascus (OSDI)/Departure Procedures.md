# 6. Departure Procedures

## Separation requirements

All aircraft departing the Damascus CTA via a common exit point shall be separated longitudinally by at least **10NM** constant or increasing.

If this is not possible, then the concerned controller shall ~~blame the tower~~ hand the aircraft off to Damascus Control in climbing or with a cleared altitude of **13000ft** once separation is assured.

## Speed control

Aircraft must adhere to **250 or less below 10000ft** due to the size of the Damascus TMA, therefore, high speed climbs may not be given.

!!! note
    SIDSs in Damascus do not have any published SID speeds.

## Direct Routings

Unless coordinated, direct routings within Damascus TMA is only permitted within their designated AOR. If a direct routing is given, special care shall be given to ensure that no potential conflicts shall arise.
